# Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
#The total number of votes cast
#A complete list of candidates who received votes
#The percentage of votes each candidate won
#The total number of votes each candidate won
#The winner of the election based on popular vote
# Your analysis should align with the following results
